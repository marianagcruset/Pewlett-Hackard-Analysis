## Summary

o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

When the silver tsunami starts to make an impact, the roles to be affected are 7: Senior Engineers, Senior Staffs, Engineers, Staffs, Technique Leaders, Assistant Engineers and Managers.

o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

In my opinion there’s not enough mentors for the next generation, to support this I created an additional table classifying all the qualify employees for the mentorship into the job titles, where you can see that for example of 29.414 Senior Engineers retiring there’s only 169 with the same position within the company that can work as mentors.
